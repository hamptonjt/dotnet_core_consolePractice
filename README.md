Learning dotnet core - this is just a small console application - or set of applications

# 100 Days of Code Challenge
This is part of the 100 Days of Code challenge.  I'm wanting to learn .net core, so I'm working from the 
beginning with some console applications and will work my way up to some complex web applications.

# Day 1
Got a small program up and running that prints shapes.  Simple little program utilizing for loops and taking input from the user.
- TODO: add command line arguments to simplify allow the user the ability to do everything in one command rather than interacting
with the program.

# Day 2
Refactored out the printing to it's own class.  Added a command line parameter for the shape.  Will need to add a 'help' command
line argument that will display all the options available.
